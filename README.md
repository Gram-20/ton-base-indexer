# TON Base indexer

The Simple TON Blockchain indexer is designed to index all messages with comments. 
It serves as a starting point for the Gram-20 indexer architecture, 
offering a scalable and resilient data source for protocol implementation.

## Architecture

This tool is based on [re-doubt/ton-indexer](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-indexer), which itself
is based on [toncenter/ton-indexer](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer).
The indexer architecture is shown on the following image:
